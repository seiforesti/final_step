# üéØ OVERLEAF FREE PLAN SOLUTION

## THE REALITY

Your 90-page document is **TOO LARGE** for Overleaf's free plan timeout.

**You have 2 choices:**

---

## ‚úÖ OPTION 1: UPGRADE OVERLEAF ($12/month)

### Best Solution - Professional Results

**Cost**: $12 for 1 month (cancel anytime)

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Full 90-page document compiles

## ‚úÖ OPTION 2: COMPILE IN PARTS (FREE)

### Split into smaller documents for free plan

I can create 4 separate Overleaf projects:
- Project 1: Introduction + Chapter 1 (18 pages)
- Project 2: Chapter 2 (20 pages)
- Project 3: Chapter 3 (30 pages)
- Project 4: Chapter 4 + Conclusion (20 pages)

Each will compile on free plan, then combine PDFs.

**Pros**: Free
**Cons**: More work, need to combine PDFs manually

## üí° MY STRONG RECOMMENDATION

**Pay $12 for 1 month of Overleaf Premium**

**Why**:
1. Your document will look professional
2. Easy to edit and preview
3. No splitting/combining needed
4. Worth it for your PFE defense
5. Can cancel after 1 month

**The local PDF looks bad because**:
- Missing proper font rendering
