# Database Connection Pool Exhaustion Fix

## Problem Summary

Your backend is experiencing a critical database connection pool exhaustion issue:

- **Connection pool at capacity: 0/0** - The pool is completely empty
- **"FATAL: sorry, too many clients already"** - PostgreSQL has reached its maximum connection limit
- **Database unavailable errors** - The application can't establish new connections
- **Connection pool exhaustion** - All connections are consumed and not being returned

## Root Causes

1. **Aggressive connection pool settings** - Pool size (20) + overflow (10) = 30 connections
2. **Low semaphore timeout** - Only 0.5 seconds to acquire connections
3. **Connection leaks** - Connections not being properly returned to the pool
4. **PostgreSQL connection limit** - Hitting the 100 connection limit

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Reduced Connection Pool Size
- **Pool size**: 20 → 15 (reduced by 25%)
- **Max overflow**: 10 → 5 (reduced by 50%)
- **Total connections**: 30 → 20 (reduced by 33%)

### 2. Increased Timeouts
- **Semaphore timeout**: 0.5s → 5.0s (10x increase)
- **Pool timeout**: 30s → 60s (2x increase)
- **Pool recycle**: 1800s → 900s (2x faster recycling)

### 3. Improved Connection Management
- **Aggressive cleanup**: Every 15 seconds instead of 30
- **Lower cleanup threshold**: 60% instead of 70%
- **Better circuit breaker**: Opens faster (5 failures in 30s)

### 4. Enhanced Recovery Mechanisms
- **Automatic pool cleanup** when utilization > 60%
- **Engine recreation** when pool is exhausted
- **Connection killing** for idle connections > 1 minute
- **Transaction cleanup** for idle transactions > 1 minute

## Files Modified

### `app/db_config.py`
- Reduced pool sizes and timeouts
- Added safer validation limits
- Improved cleanup settings

### `app/db_session.py`
- Enhanced connection recovery logic
- Added force cleanup functions
- Improved error handling and logging

### `docker-compose.yml`
- Updated environment variables to match new config
- Aligned with safer connection limits

### `quick_fix_db_pool.py`
- Complete rewrite for emergency connection cleanup
- Kills idle connections and transactions
- Provides detailed connection status

### `restart_services.ps1`
- Enhanced PowerShell restart script
- Includes connection pool fix option
- Better service management

## Immediate Actions Required

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the connection pool fix script
python quick_fix_db_pool.py
```

### Option 2: Full Service Restart
```powershell
# Run the PowerShell restart script
.\restart_services.ps1
# Choose option 2 for full restart with connection pool fix
```

### Option 3: Manual Docker Restart
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Start PostgreSQL first
docker-compose up -d postgres
# Wait 30 seconds

# Start other services
docker-compose up -d
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Monitor Connection Usage
```bash
# Check current connections
docker exec -it data_governance_postgres psql -U postgres -d data_governance -c "
SELECT count(*) as total_connections,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'active') as active,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle') as idle
FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'data_governance';"
```

### 2. Set Up Alerts
- Monitor connection count > 15
- Alert on pool utilization > 70%
- Watch for "too many clients" errors

### 3. Regular Maintenance
- Run connection cleanup weekly
- Monitor for connection leaks
- Review connection patterns

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **Connection pool exhaustion** should stop
2. **Database unavailable errors** should decrease significantly
3. **Connection pool capacity** will be more stable
4. **Recovery time** from issues will be faster
5. **Overall stability** should improve

## Monitoring

Watch for these indicators of improvement:

- ✅ Connection pool warnings decrease
- ✅ Database unavailable errors stop
- ✅ Pool utilization stays under 60%
- ✅ Connection count stays under 20
- ✅ No more "too many clients" errors

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check PostgreSQL logs** for connection errors
2. **Monitor connection count** in real-time
3. **Run connection pool fix** script
4. **Restart services** if necessary
5. **Review application code** for connection leaks

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Implement connection pooling** at the application level
2. **Add connection monitoring** and alerting
3. **Review database queries** for optimization
4. **Consider connection pooling proxy** (PgBouncer)
5. **Implement proper connection lifecycle management**

**Note**: These changes prioritize stability over performance. Once the system is stable, you can gradually increase pool sizes while monitoring for issues.
