## Technical Architecture

### Backend Integration Mapping

```typescript
// Complete API Integration
ComplianceAPIs.ComplianceManagement.getRequirements() → compliance_rule_routes.py
ComplianceAPIs.ComplianceReporting.getReports() → compliance_reports_routes.py
ComplianceAPIs.ComplianceWorkflows.getWorkflows() → compliance_workflows_routes.py
ComplianceAPIs.Audit.logActivity() → audit logging system
```

### RBAC Permission Structure

```typescript
// Granular Permission System
compliance.dashboard.view
compliance.requirements.{view|create|edit|delete}
compliance.reports.{view|create|edit|delete}
compliance.workflows.{view|create|edit|delete}
compliance.integrations.{view|manage}
compliance.analytics.view
compliance.settings.{view|manage}
compliance.audit.view
compliance.data.{export|import}
compliance.users.manage
```
