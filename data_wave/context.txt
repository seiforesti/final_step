Each group is represented by its own SPA, which orchestrates and manages all components and workflows for that group. All SPAs are fully RBAC-governed and interconnected.


Task: Build the Racine (Root) Main Manager SPA
Background & Requirements
The racine main manager is the ultimate orchestrator and master controller for the entire data governance system.
It must provide a unified, intelligent, and modern workspace for users to interact with, supervise, and manage all 7 groups (6 core + RBAC).
The old plan for this SPA is under /ADVANCED_ENTERPRISE_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md (see "UNIFIED GOVERNANCE SPA ARCHITECTURE"). Use its advanced architectural ideas as a reference, but design a new, more modular, flexible, and intelligent architecture.


                                                                                                                                                      Key Features & Views to Implement (Enhanced for Enterprise-Grade, Intelligent Data Governance)

Describe every feature, view, and service in detail, and ensure all logic is mapped to real backend implementations for a truly modern, intelligent, and enterprise-grade data governance platform.}", then cursor agent background realise the "RACINE_MAIN_MANAGER_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md and started  building it step by step, so following ", task by task and phase by phase correctly so deeply analyzing every thing necesseary and analyze deeply the "RACINE_MAIN_MANAGER_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md
"locate ur step in the "RACINE_MAIN_MANAGER_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.m" and  plan to verify deeply with reasoning that the current state implimentation of (types/, hooks/, services/, utils/, andd constants/) are 100% mapped and aligned to target backend racine system implimentation and there is not any missed (types/, hooks/, services/, utils/, andd constants/ bazed on the "RACINE_MAIN_MANAGER_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md" and for other side check deeply with advanced reasoning and thinking that the "(types/, hooks/, services/, utils/, andd constants/)" between each others interconnections use are correctly done becaause after we have implimented all "(types/, hooks/, services/, utils/, andd constants/)" we have added some updates on types, services like v15_enhanced_1/components/racine-main-manager/services/racine-orchestration-apis.ts, v15_enhanced_1/components/racine-main-manager/types/api.types.ts, v15_enhanced_1/components/racine-main-manager/types/racine-core.types.ts, etc... so we want also for second step a Validate complete mapping between backend models/services/routes and frontend types/services/hooks
Test complete integration between frontend and backend racine implementations    , after that this task but this task is more complicated and i cant dever deeply meaning and straightfully and advancelly description the task details because i want all plan of the system racine system from mapping to backend implimentations to plan inside components groups to all the system so please sofisticate and plish and enhance for more better and more fowerful detailed tasks description"ok now after ensuring that all frontend "(types/, hooks/, services/, utils/, andd constants/) are 100% mapped and aligned to target backend racine system implimentation and there is not any missed implimentation, so no bazed on the "RACINE_MAIN_MANAGER_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md" there is a not clear vision yet how to build all the components group of all the "v15_enhanced_1/components/racine-main-manager/", because there is less descriptions for every advanced powerful component structure wich and for each group structue, so now after the we have successfully completed all the "(types/, hooks/, services/, utils/, andd constants/) " we can start building all the group components plan but we need a strong advanced detailed powerful modlar description plan tasks for every group components and for evey components itself , so here is the work i want u to plan a advanced detailed entreprise tasks to ensure we build correctly all components groups correctly and successfully using all 100% backend implimentation in "(types/, hooks/, services/, utils/, andd constants/) ", first for the group "navigation/" wich we need for the hole plateform data governance  so it has 7 advanced powerful components "│   │   ├── AppNavbar.tsx                        # Global intelligent navbar (2500+ lines)

", now i want u to successfully run the backend first inside a docker container scripts_automation/docker-compose.yml called data_governance_backend so we will try to run it and fix errors to ensure that the container for backend will successfully run correctly after we will fix the frontend to run successfuly aligned to 100% backend , the frontend is inside @v15_enhanced_1/ , the backend needs manay and many fixes under backend/
scripts_automation/app/models/
scripts_automation/app/services/
scripts_automation/app/api/routes/, so now u have to understand the logic of all my application datagovernance then we will start by running the backend engine inside container and fix all the backend errors, so now u have to run the container and try rload it to inspect and audit errors then start fixing them to ensure a advanced powerful real hardcore logic backend implimentataion core entreprise data governance ready for production and ready to be tested with the  advanced frontend, NOTE is critical and import, those are rules, follow them advancely and with deep reasoning, 1: dont u ever rebuild container because it takes many many times so add the requirement needed in requirement.txt after that install it manually in container, to avoid waste time, 2:this projet is at level rated high level build so if u find errors or missed imports or implimentations or not real advanced logic implimentation, dont comment it dont delete it dont replace it with basic implimentation instead impliment a advanced entreprise core level implimentation to ensure a real logic advanced for real production for  a modern powerful daatagovernance plateforme application also dont damage the state of backend to ensure that is choesive and interconnected and at advanced level to be tested with frontend, so alaway keep that on ur mind we aim for a advanced backend system powerful ready for work without any issues or bugs, and other important thing is to audit and find evry basic implementation wich mean with mock/stubs/sample immplimentation and replace it with advanced hardcode level core netreprise integrated with current backend implementation and interconnected to ensure cohesive interconnected system , probably those implementation will be commented above with those exemple "# In a real implementation, ...
# This would integrate with ....
# Mock implementation" not precisely like that but seems like that so inspedct and audit all backend implementation replaceing all mock stubs basic implementation with real backend advanced interconnected logic while ure fixing the backend since u relod backend inside container
