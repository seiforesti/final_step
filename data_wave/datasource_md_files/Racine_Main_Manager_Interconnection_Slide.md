# Slide — Racine Main Manager: Enterprise Orchestrator of All Governance Bases

> Racine Main Manager is the orchestration heart that synchronizes all seven bases end‑to‑end: it plans, executes, monitors, and adapts workflows that span Data Sources, Scans, Rules, Classification, Catalog, Compliance, and RBAC.

- **Unified Control Plane**
  - Centralizes workflow definitions, priorities, and SLAs across all modules
  - Coordinates background jobs, user actions, and event‑driven automations

- **Data Source ↔ Scan Logic / Rule Sets**
  - Selects target data sources, applies Scan‑Rule‑Sets, chooses execution strategy (sequential/parallel/adaptive)
  - Enforces pool/replica usage policies and throttling to protect databases

- **Scan Logic ↔ Classification**
  - Streams discovered structures and samples to the classification engine
  - Feeds AI models (scikit‑learn/transformers) for labeling and sensitivity scoring

- **Discovery/Scans ↔ Data Catalog**
  - Publishes entities, columns, types, sizes, and lineage into the catalog
  - Maintains incremental sync and schema change awareness

- **Classification/Quality ↔ Compliance**
  - Maps labels and quality metrics to SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA/PCI‑DSS controls
  - Triggers automated compliance checks, remediation tasks, and audit entries

- **RBAC / Access Everywhere**
  - Gates every operation (create/update/delete/scan/discover) with fine‑grained permissions
  - Records complete audit trails for user, action, scope, and outcome

- **Adaptive Orchestration & Health**
  - Live performance telemetry (latency, errors, pool load) drives adaptive strategies
  - Circuit‑breaker/rate‑limit/throttle integration prevents cascading failures

- **End‑to‑End Workflow Example**
  - Plan → Validate connections → Discover schemas → Apply Rule Sets → Classify → Update Catalog/Lineage → Run Compliance → Report/Alert
  - Each step inherits provider/TLS/replica/RBAC context from `DataSource` and module configs

- **Outcome**
  - One governed pipeline from source to policy, continuously optimized and audited
  - Consistent behavior across on‑prem, cloud, and hybrid, at enterprise scale
