# Slides — Functional & Non‑Functional Requirements (Advanced Data Governance)

---

## Slide — Functional Requirements

- **Data Source Onboarding**: Register, validate, and monitor with TLS/replicas/pooling.
- **Schema Discovery & Lineage**: Auto‑inventory assets and maintain end‑to‑end lineage.
- **Metadata Catalog & Search**: Unified registry with semantic search and versions.
- **Classification & DLP**: Detect sensitive data and enforce masking/tokenization.
- **Access Governance**: Time‑bound, least‑privilege approvals for data access.
- **Data Quality & Profiling**: Profile datasets and enforce quality rules at gates.
- **Compliance & Evidence**: Map controls and generate audit‑ready reports.
- **Consent & Rights (DSAR)**: Enforce purpose limits and fulfill data‑subject requests.
- **Retention & Deletion**: Apply schedules, legal holds, and verifiable erasure.
- **Incident Management**: Detect violations, alert, and orchestrate remediation.
- **Integrations**: Bi‑directional APIs/webhooks to SIEM, IAM, ETL, catalogs, ticketing.

## Slide — Non‑Functional Requirements

- **Availability**: 99.9–99.99% uptime with graceful degradation and self‑healing.
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker, adaptive throttling, and backpressure protections.
- **Performance**: Sub‑second metadata queries; P95 < 2s for heavy operations.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scale across services and edge nodes; zero‑downtime.
- **Security**: TLS in transit, encryption at rest, strong RBAC/MFA and isolation.
- **Privacy & Compliance**: Data residency controls and immutable audit logs.
- **Observability**: Logs/metrics/traces with SLO alerts and health dashboards.
- **Interoperability**: Open APIs, standard formats, and portable connectors.
- **Maintainability**: Modular services, versioned APIs, non‑breaking upgrades.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Autoscaling, edge execution, tiered storage, smart caching.
