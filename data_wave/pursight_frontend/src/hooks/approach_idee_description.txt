Plateforme de Catalogue de Données Pilotée par l'IA avec Classification et Traçabilité Améliorées

Développement d'une plateforme intelligente de gouvernance et de classification de données multi-sources (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL) via des pipelines ML hybrides. Elle automatise l’étiquetage de sensibilité, la traçabilité en temps réel, et intègre des modèles IA pour combler les limites des solutions existantes comme Purview et Databricks.


La gouvernance des données dans les environnements utilisant PostgreSQL, MongoDB et MySQL est entravée par des lacunes critiques dans les solutions existantes telles que Microsoft Purview. Ces limitations incluent l'absence de classification automatique efficace, d'étiquetage de sensibilité adapté, d'application dynamique de politiques, et de traçabilité complète des données. Cette situation compromet la conformité, la sécurité et la gestion optimale des données. Notre projet vise à surmonter ces défis en intégrant une approche pilotée par l'IA qui améliore la précision, l'efficacité et l'adaptabilité de la gouvernance des données, tout en offrant des fonctionnalités avancées telles que des analyses détaillées, des tableaux de bord personnalisables et des contrôles de sécurité renforcés.

What’s Missing or Could Be Further Enhanced
Pydantic v2 config warnings: Not critical, but update your Pydantic models to use from_attributes instead of orm_mode for full v2 compatibility.
Advanced feature extraction: The current feature extraction is a stub; you can expand it to use richer metadata, statistics, and user actions for better ML performance.
ML model evaluation: No automated accuracy/precision/recall calculation or feedback loop yet.
UI for admin/model management: No web interface for managing feedback, retraining, or model versions (but all endpoints are ready).
User feedback loop: No UI for users to provide feedback on suggestions (API is ready).
Model rollback/version selection: No endpoint/UI for rolling back to previous model versions.
Notification channels: Only in-app notifications; no email/SMS/push integration yet.
Comprehensive test coverage: Not explicitly mentioned, but recommended for production.



Let's proceed with the next most impactful backend enhancement:
Model rollback/version selection endpoint (this is a true enterprise feature and will set you apart from Purview).

Plan:

Add an endpoint to set the active ML model version (for rollback or A/B testing).
Update the ML service to load and use the selected model version for predictions.
Track the current active version in the database.
I will implement:

A new field in the MLModelVersion table to indicate if a version is active.
Logic in the ML service to load the active model version.
An API endpoint to set the active version.


You now have a robust, advanced model versioning and rollback system:

The ML service saves each model version to disk and tracks which is active.
The service always loads and uses the active model for predictions.
A new API endpoint /ml-set-active-version allows you to set the active model version (for rollback or A/B testing) at any time.
This is a true enterprise feature, exceeding what Purview offers.
You can now safely roll back, promote, or test ML models in production.

////////////////how we did the tests part//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Certainly! Here’s a clear explanation of how the tests were set up, what was used, and how the SQLite file-based database (sqlite:///./test.db) was leveraged for robust, environment-agnostic testing:

1. Test Environment Setup
Goal: Ensure all tests for the FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/SQLModel backend run reliably, both locally (Windows, Mac, Linux) and in containers (e.g., Docker), with correct database handling and no missing tables.
Challenge: The production backend uses PostgreSQL, but for local and CI testing, we want a lightweight, fast, and isolated database that doesn’t require external services.
2. Using SQLite as a Mock Database
Why SQLite?

It’s file-based, requires no server, and is included with Python.
It simulates most SQL features needed for tests.
It’s fast and easy to reset between test runs.
How was it configured?

In conftest.py, we set the environment variable DB_URL to sqlite:///./test.db before any database code runs.
This tells SQLAlchemy/SQLModel to use a SQLite database file named test.db in the project root.
In db_session.py, the engine is created using this DB_URL, so all DB operations in tests use SQLite.
3. Ensuring All Tables Exist
Problem: Some models (like Notification) use SQLAlchemy’s Base, not SQLModel, so SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine) would not create all tables.
Solution: In the test setup (conftest.py), we switched to Base.metadata.create_all(engine), which creates all tables for all SQLAlchemy models, including Notification.
Implementation: This table creation is done in a session-scoped, autouse pytest fixture, so it runs once before any tests.
4. Test Execution
Test Client: FastAPI’s TestClient is used to simulate API requests in tests.
Isolation: Each test function gets a fresh client, and the SQLite DB is reset at the start of the test session.
Reliability: Using a file-based SQLite DB (sqlite:///./test.db) avoids issues with in-memory DBs (which don’t persist across threads/connections), ensuring all tests see the same schema and data.
5. Summary of What Was Used
SQLite file-based DB as a mock for PostgreSQL: sqlite:///./test.db
SQLAlchemy’s Base.metadata.create_all(engine) to create all tables, including those not defined with SQLModel.
Pytest fixtures for setup and teardown.
FastAPI’s TestClient for API endpoint testing.
6. Result
All tests now pass reliably, with no missing table errors.
The test setup is robust, fast, and works identically on any OS or CI system, without needing a real Postgres server.
Let me know if you want a code snippet or further details on any part!

////////////////////////integrating RBAC/////////////////////////////
thank you for the reminder! Here’s an updated summary including the integration of the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system, which is a key enhancement for secure and enterprise-grade sensitivity labeling:

Project Approach (with RBAC Integration)
1. Vision & Motivation
Build a modular, extensible, and secure sensitivity labeling/data governance backend, with advanced features and developer experience beyond Microsoft Purview.
2. Key Features & Enhancements
Custom Sensitivity Label Model: Rich schema for labels, proposals, audits, reviews, notifications, and ML feedback.
Advanced ML Integration: Pluggable ML service for label prediction, feedback, and retraining.
Notification System: Flexible notification model with user preferences and lifecycle management.
API-First Design: All features exposed via FastAPI endpoints.
Testability: Fully isolated, environment-agnostic test setup using SQLite.
Extensibility: Easy to add new label types, workflows, or integrations.
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Integration
Purpose: Securely manage who can view, propose, approve, audit, or administer sensitivity labels and related actions.
Implementation:
User Roles: Defined roles such as Data Steward, Reviewer, Admin, Auditor, etc.
Permissions: Each API endpoint and action is protected by role checks (e.g., only Reviewers can approve/reject proposals, only Admins can manage users).
Integration: RBAC logic is enforced in FastAPI routes, using dependency injection or middleware to check user roles before allowing access.
Extensible: New roles and permissions can be added as needed for future requirements.
Enhancement over Purview: More flexible, transparent, and developer-friendly RBAC, with full code ownership and easy customization.
3. What Has Been Done
All core models, API endpoints, ML service, notification system, and robust test setup (using SQLite) are implemented.
RBAC system is integrated, ensuring secure, role-based access to all sensitive operations and data.
All tests pass, including those for RBAC-protected endpoints.
4. Next Steps: UI Frontend
The frontend will respect and visualize RBAC: users will only see and be able to perform actions allowed by their roles.
Admins can manage users and roles from the UI.
The UI will provide clear feedback when access is denied due to insufficient permissions.
In summary:
Your platform now includes a robust RBAC system, providing secure, fine-grained access control for all sensitivity labeling and governance operations—making it more advanced and flexible than Purview, and ready for enterprise use.

Let me know if you want a sample RBAC code snippet, a UI wireframe for role management, or further details!



/////////////frontend//////////////////
Absolutely! Here’s a deep, structured plan and architectural approach for building a next-generation, highly adaptable, and visually impressive frontend for your advanced sensitivity labeling platform—outclassing both Microsoft Purview and Databricks in flexibility, UX, and code quality.

1. Architectural Vision
a. Core Principles
Separation of Concerns: Clear split between data models, API hooks, UI components, and page layouts.
Type Safety & Scalability: Use TypeScript interfaces for all backend models and API responses.
Reusable Data Hooks: Centralized React hooks for all backend data operations (CRUD, search, ML, RBAC, notifications).
State Management: Use React Query (TanStack Query) for data fetching, caching, and mutation, ensuring real-time UI updates and cache consistency.
RBAC-Driven UI: All UI elements and actions are dynamically shown/hidden/enabled based on user roles and permissions.
Design System: Build on a modern, customizable component library (e.g., MUI, Chakra, or Ant Design) with your own theme for a Databricks-inspired, enterprise look.
2. Folder & Code Structure
/src
  /api         # All API hooks and data fetching logic (React Query)
  /models      # TypeScript interfaces for backend models (Label, Proposal, Notification, etc.)
  /components  # Reusable UI components (tables, dialogs, forms, charts, etc.)
  /pages       # Page-level components (Home, Jobs, Notebooks, SensitivityLabels, etc.)
  /layout      # App shell, navigation, RBAC context, modals
  /hooks       # Custom hooks (RBAC, notifications, feature flags, etc.)
  /theme       # Design system, custom styles, branding
  /utils       # Utility functions, helpers
3. Data Binding & API Integration
TypeScript Models: Mirror backend models in /models (e.g., Label.ts, Notification.ts, UserRole.ts).
React Query Hooks: In /api, create hooks like useLabels(), useProposals(), useNotifications(), useMLService(), useRBAC(), each using axios or fetch and returning strongly-typed data.
RBAC Context: Provide a context/provider that exposes the current user’s roles/permissions, and helper hooks like useCan(action, resource) for conditional rendering.
4. UI/UX Design Philosophy
Databricks-Inspired Layout: Left nav, top bar, responsive content area, modals/drawers for detail/edit, rich tables with inline actions, and advanced filtering/search.
Dynamic, Role-Aware UI: All actions (edit, approve, audit, ML feedback, etc.) are only visible/enabled if the user’s role allows it.
Live Feedback: Use toasts, banners, and real-time updates for all user actions.
ML & Notification Integration: Show ML predictions, allow feedback, and display notifications in a global notification center.
Accessibility & Theming: High-contrast, accessible, and easily themeable for enterprise branding.
5. Example: Sensitivity Label Management Flow
Page: /sensitivity-labels
Table: List all labels, with status, color, description, and actions (view, edit, propose, audit, review).
Drawer/Modal: Show label details, history, and ML suggestions.
RBAC: Only reviewers/admins see approve/reject buttons; only stewards see propose/edit.
ML Feedback: Users can submit feedback on label predictions, retrain models, and see version history.
Notifications: Users see real-time updates for proposals, reviews, and audits.
6. Next Steps
Scaffold /models and /api: Generate TypeScript interfaces and React Query hooks for all backend entities.
Set Up RBAC Context: Implement a provider and hooks for role-based UI logic.
Design System: Choose and theme a component library for a Databricks-like look.
Build Core Pages: Start with Sensitivity Labels, Proposals, Notifications, and ML Feedback.
Iterate on UX: Use inspiration from Purview and Databricks, but push further with clarity, speed, and flexibility.
7. Magic Touches
Hardcore Code: All data flows are typed, testable, and modular. No spaghetti code.
Intelligent UI: Context-aware, predictive, and user-friendly—always showing the right info and actions.
Enterprise-Ready: Built-in audit trails, RBAC, and extensibility for future features.
If you’re ready, I can start scaffolding the /models and /api folders, and provide a sample of the Sensitivity Label management page with full data binding and RBAC-driven UI. Just let me know your preferred component library (MUI, Chakra, AntD, or custom), and I’ll begin!
