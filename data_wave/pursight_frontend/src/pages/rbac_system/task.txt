✅ Goal: Full Refactoring and Advanced Rebuild of RBAC System
We are rebuilding the RBAC system (backend + frontend) to match or surpass the standards of Azure RBAC and Databricks RBAC in terms of:
UI/UX design quality (modern, dark theme, enterprise-grade)
Advanced and modular workflow logic
Highly granular role and permission control
Flexible architecture that supports SPA-level management of RBAC
Extensibility and scalability

🛠️ Current State
Backend
Located in:
app/models/auth_models.py
app/services/role_service.py
app/services/notification_service.py
app/api/routes/rbac/rbac_routes.py
Already exposes APIs used by frontend (rbac.ts)
Frontend
RBAC pages in:
src/pages/rbac_system/
Uses Ant Design and traditional layouts
Current dashboard: rbacadmindashboard.tsx (acts as SPA entry point)
Inspired by Azure RBAC but very basic and outdated
Refactoring Plan Draft
File: RBAC_UI_REFACTORING.md (INCOMPLETE and misses critical logic changes)

❗❗ Problems with Current Work
Only UI styling (dark mode, Azure-style) was applied — without changing workflow structure or dashboard logic.
The new implementation just mirrors old pages with minor cosmetic tweaks.
Toggle between old/new UI is not part of the desired redesign.
Workflow action logic and user interactions (sidebar, headers, RBAC interactions) are still basic and static.
No major enhancements were made in frontend-to-backend logic or overall flexibility.

✅ Target Outcome
Design and build a from-scratch, advanced enterprise-level RBAC system, using the current APIs and adding enhancements where needed.

🧩 Modular Task Breakdown for Refactor
📁 1. Backend Enhancements
Fully audit the existing RBAC backend APIs (in rbac_routes.py, role_service.py, etc.)
Expose additional APIs to support:
Real-time permission updates
Role hierarchies
Permission scoping by data domain/schema
Audit logs (RBAC-related)
Notifications & user event hooks
Add missing features (if needed) and document them clearly

💻 2. Frontend Full Redesign
🔧 General Requirements
Remove use of basic/traditional libraries like Ant Design
Build custom UI components matching Azure RBAC/Databricks-grade:
Modern layout
Responsive SPA
Dark theme default
All pages under /src/pages/rbac_system/ should be rebuilt completely using new logic and design
🧱 Components & Structure
Replace rbacadmindashboard.tsx with a fully redesigned dashboard that:
Supports modular component loading
Has intelligent sidebars (dynamic per user roles/permissions)
Includes granular control panels (roles, permissions, scopes)
Allows for nested workflow actions per role/resource
Integrate real-time state sync via hooks in rbac.ts
Use backend services to power all actions (create/edit/delete role, assign roles, audit)

⚙️ 3. Workflow Actions Redesign
Implement intelligent, granular workflows, such as:
Conditional rendering of permissions/actions based on user roles
Fine-grained scope selection per data schema/object/resource
Dynamic action panels (e.g. assign permission, revoke, audit)
Context-aware role assignment (based on business rules)
Full control lifecycle: define → assign → audit → revoke

🧠 4. Inspiration Implementation (Azure RBAC Features)
Use folder:
/src/pages/rbac/azure_rbac_screenshots/
…to implement Azure-style experiences in:
Sidebar structure
Permission-granting logic
Role scoping
Data-level access controls
These screenshots should inspire, not copy. Adapt to your system’s data governance context.

🚀 Deliverables
TaskOutput

🔚 Final Notes
This is not a UI facelift. This is a complete transformation of the RBAC system, backend and frontend — with modern, modular, intelligent, and scalable architecture that supports full data governance access control, at the same standard as Azure/Databricks RBAC                                                 🔧 TASK LIST: Advanced RBAC System Rebuild
This is a full redesign and enhancement of the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system, both frontend and backend, inspired by Azure RBAC and Databricks, with advanced UI, logic, and workflow structure.

🧩 [TASK 1] Deep Analysis of Current Implementation
Analyze all backend RBAC logic under:

auth_models.py

role_service.py

notification_service.py

rbac_routes.py

Analyze frontend logic under:

src/pages/rbac_system/

rbacadmindashboard.tsx

src/api/rbac.ts

🎯 [TASK 2] Backend Enhancements
Audit and document existing RBAC endpoints and services

Add missing advanced APIs if necessary, such as:

Real-time permission updates

Role inheritance

Schema-based access scoping

RBAC audit logging

Notifications/hooks integration

Ensure all APIs are RESTful and callable from frontend (rbac.ts)

Write clean documentation for new services

💻 [TASK 3] Full Redesign of RBAC Frontend UI
Rebuild all components under src/pages/rbac_system/ with:

Modern design inspired by Azure RBAC

Custom components (no Ant Design or basic UI libraries)

Dark theme as default

Responsive layouts and SPA behavior

Replace rbacadmindashboard.tsx:

New structure with modular views, advanced layout, and logic

Dynamic sidebar, topbar, role panels, permission editors

🔁 [TASK 4] Workflow Action System Upgrade
Redesign and implement new workflow actions:

Assign role → select scope → apply permissions → notify/audit

Intelligent UI flow based on user role & resource type

Context-aware control: e.g. restrict actions based on schema ownership

Integrate backend logic with rbac.ts hooks

Add real-time state handling if needed (e.g. with WebSocket or polling)

🧠 [TASK 5] Implement Azure/Databricks-Inspired UX Patterns
Use screenshot references in:

src/pages/rbac/azure_rbac_screenshots/

Apply design concepts, not copy-paste — adapt to our data governance context

Ensure side navigation, role/permission management panels, modal actions, and granular scoping match the enterprise UX standards

📘 [TASK 6] Finalize and Complete the Refactoring Plan
Complete and update RBAC_UI_REFACTORING.md with:

All frontend and backend changes

Component breakdowns

API integrations

Workflow redesign explanation

Document the reasoning behind all architectural decisions

📦 Expected Deliverables
Fully functional, advanced RBAC SPA

Modern and modular UI at enterprise level

Extended backend API capabilities

Complete developer documentation

Final RBAC_UI_REFACTORING.md updated
