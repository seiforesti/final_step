### **üöÄ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The backend is now ready to support the advanced frontend architecture and provide enterprise-grade data governance capabilities that surpass Databricks and Microsoft Purview in terms of:

- **AI/ML Intelligence** - Advanced pattern recognition and optimization
- **Workflow Orchestration** - Intelligent coordination and automation
- **Collaborative Development** - Team-based rule development and review
- **Real-time Analytics** - Comprehensive monitoring and insights

- **Scalability & Performance** - Production-ready architecture


we are working on a advanced lvel data-governance system so it compose by 6 groups, data sourcces, compliance, classifications, Advanced-scan-rules-sets, Advanced-catalog, and advanced-scan-logic, so we have builts the fast api advanced backend for all of those groups, under scripts_automations/app/models/, /app/services/, /app/api/routes/, after that we have builts the frontend next and react tailwind with shadn/ui and advanced tools design, we have builts under v15_enhanced_1/components/Advanced-Scan-Rule-Sets, Compliance-Rule, classifications, data-sources, Advanced-Catalog(current working on), so we have completed a advanced entreprise core level working for 4 groups "Advanced-Scan-Rule-Sets, Compliance-Rule, classifications, data-sources," and now we have workin on the Advanced-Catalog, so we have mapped all the backend assigned to Advanced-Catalog and tagged under"CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md", we have mapped to frontend parts /Advanced-Catalog/types/, /services/, /hooks/, /constants/** and /utils/, tp ensure a advanced 100% frontend aligned to backend , and we suggess the frontend plan architecture for the /Advanced-catalog group in the "ADVANCED_ENTERPRISE_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md", the second plan exactly, the plan builts and meant to be a advanced plan architecture for advanced level entreprise core advanced and intelligent catalog system, so it has many advanced architectures components, suppose to be each components more powerful super and modern designed with detailed uis shadn/design code with large code for more modern and advanced system core, and the most important is to expoloit and use and align all 100% backend to th frontend, wich mean each component build must be 100% bazed on backend implimentation, with 0% usage for mock data, the components must be builts with large code (1700+ line and more) already mention above each component in the plan, the large code ensure a modern with detailed design to enhance and make the component more advanced because the main purpose is to build a advanced caatalog group wich will be integrated with others groups with its SPA master orchestrator and others SPA groups, in racine SPA to load all groups and orchestrate the to ensure a high level modern advanced data-governance system, and that came for a advanced production purpose so we aim to surpass the relevant plateforme such as databricks and microsoft purview ad the relevant in domain data governance, so our frontend must be modern powerful user friendly and high level core with advanced and powerful wworkflow actions management for all compponents, and ensure a choesive system, so the work now is : complete the remains components for the /Advanced-Catalog/components/, group by group components, and make sure that u use and exploit all backend needed for the component and u have to make sure that each component built with advanced detailed large code design ui using shadn/ui design and advanced tools, and make sure that each component is modern with high level workflow orchestrations actions management, with enhanced and powerful views to be like or surpassing databricks and m.purview, so start analyzing deeply with reasonning the remains system implimentations and complete all components group by group bazed on the backend implimentations (0% mock data) wich mean bazed exactly on the "/types/, /services/, /hooks/, /constants/, and /utils/** and bazed on the plan architechture "ADVANCED_ROUTES_SUMMARY.md", now i want u to complete the fixing of mock data for "@ImpactAnalysisViewer.tsx then the services that u add now in @advanced-lineage.service.ts start from line(541) to use them with @useDataLineage.ts i want u to investigate the backend of the /advanced-catalog that is tagged in "CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md" and check if those services are correctly handled and implimented and integrated correctly with real logic in backend if not already integrated, second thing the importsof types for all components for /data-lineage are using many imports types, that not realy implimented in types, so check for it if it is not implimented , impliment it and ensure that is integrated and interconnected and it has its implimentations in backend, look we need to ensure that all components bind a real data aligned with real logic backend to ensure a real choesive and advanced system ready for production, so first analyzed deeply all components under /data-lineage/, and fix the "@ImpactAnalysisViewer.tsx" to use real data bazedd on backen implimentation, second, analyze all components, for all  the imports that they required all of them then check deepy the /types/, /hooks/, services/, constants/, and utils/ if the all required imports for all components are correctly handled by the backend implimentation, if not add and update missed backend implimentation under /types/, /hooks/, services/, constants/, and utils/**  then locate the target files backend implimentations that serve the group of components  /data-lineage/**, then add all missed reqired implimentation in backend to ensure a 100% frontend aligned and uses real logic backend implimentation, do a sturcture corrected advaced logic and choesive to ensure a interconnected logic
