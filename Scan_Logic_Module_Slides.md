# Scan Logic Base System - Presentation Slides

**Scan Logic System Management Overview:**
The Scan Logic system serves as the intelligent orchestration engine that coordinates, schedules, and executes data governance scans across multiple sources with advanced resource management and workflow automation. It integrates seamlessly with all governance modules to provide enterprise-grade scanning capabilities with AI-driven optimization, real-time monitoring, and adaptive execution strategies.

## Slide 1: Scan Logic Base System Overview

- **Purpose**: Central brain for executing scans across data sources using workflows and orchestration.
> **Core building blocks**: scan definitions, execution records, rule configurations, workflow stages, orchestration jobs.
- **Execution paths**:
   Workflow-driven: 
    - stage-by-stage progression through well-defined gates (INIT → VALIDATE → PROCESS → ANALYZE → REPORT → CLEANUP) with conditional branches and approvals.

    - When to use: complex, governance-heavy processes requiring human-in-the-loop checkpoints, strict compliance gates, and deterministic stage progression.

    - Strengths: explicit stage DAG, reusable templates, stage-level SLAs, auditability per gate, fine-grained retries/backoff/timeouts, and stage-scoped secrets/permissions.

    - Execution model: each stage validates preconditions, executes scoped tasks, records outcomes/metrics, and emits events for downstream stages or approvals.

    - Failure handling: stage isolation with compensating or cleanup stages, resumable runs, policy-driven escalations, and re-approval on scope or risk changes.

    - Integration: natural points to invoke classification, compliance validation, catalog enrichment, notifications, and governance reviews at ANALYZE/REPORT checkpoints.
  - Orchestration-driven: 
    global plan that allocates resources, batches work, and coordinates parallel/sequential runs across sources based on priorities and constraints.

     When to use: high-throughput, multi-source or multi-tenant operations demanding resource-aware scheduling, batching, and adaptive concurrency for cost/performance.
    Strengths: predictive resource allocation, priority queues, dynamic strategy selection (sequential/parallel/adaptive/intelligent), co-location and batching by complexity.
    - Resource & performance: respects connection limits, CPU/memory/network budgets; applies throttling and circuit-breaking; auto-scales workers based on live telemetry.
    - Backpressure & scaling: smooths spikes via queues and rate control, defers non-urgent work, and balances loads across windows and pools.
    - Recovery & resilience: hot-retry for transient faults, smart rescheduling to alternate windows/resources, quarantine of noisy batches, and idempotent updates.
- **Enterprise traits**: AI-optimized planning, adaptive strategies, priority queues, retry/recovery, RBAC, audit, metrics.

## Slide 2: How Scan Logic Operates and Integrates

- **Scheduling and triggers**: calendar/cron-based runs; event- and manual triggers for on-demand scans.
- **Execution pipeline**:
  - Validation: source reachability, permissions, rule sanity; dependency checks.
  - Planning: resource sizing, strategy selection (sequential/parallel/intelligent), stage graph build.
  - Execution: rule batches executed; progress, retries, backoff, timeouts.
  - Post-processing: persist results, catalog enrichment, classification/compliance hooks.
- **System integration**: ties into Data Catalog, Classifications, Compliance, Lineage, Analytics via integration contracts.
- **Performance**: connection pooling, thread/async execution, caching, adaptive concurrency, predictive resource allocation.

## Slide 3: Features, Reliability, and Production Controls

- **Features**: multi-source scanning, column/table granularity, intelligent batching, incremental support, health & insights.
- **Reliability**: stage/task retries, recovery stages, circuit-breaker-like throttling, timeouts, idempotent updates.
- **Observability**: run-level and orchestration-level metrics, health endpoints, live streams.
- **Security & governance**: role-based gates, audit trails, compliance validations, sensitive data handling.

## Slide 4: Scan Rule Sets vs. Scan Logic — Advanced Capabilities, Relationship, and Differences

- **Scan Rule Sets – Advanced Functionalities (WHAT)**
    - Define WHAT to scan: rich scoping controls, rule templates, AI pattern recognition, and enterprise governance with lifecycle management.
    - Reusable rule libraries: version control, approval workflows, business/compliance mappings, and cross-source portability for consistent data governance.

- **Scan Logic – Advanced Functionalities (HOW)**
  - Orchestrate HOW scans execute: workflow engines, resource-aware scheduling, AI optimization, and adaptive execution strategies across multiple sources.
  - Enterprise reliability: predictive allocation, priority queues, real-time monitoring, failure recovery, and comprehensive observability for production operations.

> **Relationship & Interaction (HOW consumes WHAT)**
  - Scan Logic consumes rule sets to build execution plans and orchestrated workflows, while feeding results back to optimize rule baselines and governance KPIs.
  - Cross-module integration: scan outcomes drive catalog enrichment, classification labels, compliance validations, and lineage tracking across the entire platform.

- **Key Differences in the Project**
  - **Focus**: Rule Sets describe WHAT to scan and which rules apply; Scan Logic defines HOW, WHEN, and WITH WHAT resources they execute.
  - **Data model anchors**: Rule Sets—rule sets and rule catalogs; Scan Logic—workflows, orchestration plans, executions, and resource allocations.
  - **Ownership & lifecycle**: Rule Sets managed by governance teams (templates, reviews, versions); Scan Logic owned by platform/ops (scheduling, orchestration SLAs, performance).
  - **Failure domains**: Rule issues → validation or rule-set quality gates; Execution issues → retries, recovery stages, rescheduling, or reallocation.
  - **Scalability levers**: Rule Sets—scope reduction, sampling, rule optimization; Scan Logic—strategy choice, concurrency, resource pools, intelligent batching.
