# RBAC/Access Control System - Detailed Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

The RBAC/Access Control system represents the foundational security layer of the PurSight data governance platform, providing enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and access management across all modules. This system implements a comprehensive security framework that combines traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with advanced Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), OAuth integration, and sophisticated audit capabilities to ensure the highest levels of security for sensitive data operations.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Security Model

The RBAC system operates on a multi-layered security architecture that encompasses:

1. **Authentication Layer**: Multi-modal authentication supporting session-based, token-based, and API key authentication
2. **Authorization Layer**: Dynamic permission evaluation with role inheritance and attribute-based conditions
3. **Resource Management Layer**: Hierarchical resource scoping with granular access controls
4. **Audit Layer**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of all security events
5. **Integration Layer**: Seamless integration with all data governance modules

### Security Principles

The system implements several key security principles:

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every access request is validated regardless of source
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive only the minimum permissions necessary
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between authentication, authorization, and resource management
- **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging of all security-related activities

## Data Models and Database Schema
