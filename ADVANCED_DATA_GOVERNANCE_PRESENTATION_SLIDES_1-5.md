## Slide 3: Project Context

### **Current Data Governance Landscape Analysis**

**Microsoft Azure Purview** provides comprehensive data discovery, classification, and lineage tracking with strong enterprise integration capabilities. However, critical limitations exist:

- **Limited Database Support**: Integration Runtime lacks native support for MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Manual Classification Processes**: Requires extensive manual intervention for unsupported data sources
- **Complex Custom Connector Development**: High technical overhead for extending platform capabilities

**Databricks Data Governance** offers unified analytics with strong ML/AI integration but faces:

- **Platform Lock-in**: Primarily cloud-specific with limited on-premises flexibility  
- **Complex Multi-Database Orchestration**: Challenges in coordinating diverse data sources
- **Limited Real-time Governance**: Gaps in continuous compliance monitoring

### **Enterprise Requirements Gap**

Organizations utilizing **MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL** and other databases face:
- **Fragmented Data Management**: Multiple tools for different data sources
- **Compliance Complexity**: Manual processes for regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- **Scalability Limitations**: Performance bottlenecks with growing data volumes
- **Integration Challenges**: Complex workflows across heterogeneous environments

## Slide 4: Identified Problematic - Current Limitations

### **Critical Gaps in Existing Data Governance Platforms**

#### **1. Database Integration Limitations**
- **Microsoft Purview Integration Runtime**: Does not support direct connectivity to MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL databases
- **Manual Data Source Registration**: Requires complex workarounds and custom development
- **Limited Metadata Extraction**: Incomplete schema discovery and lineage tracking
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Inefficient data scanning and classification processes

#### **2. Enterprise Scalability Challenges**
- **Manual Classification Workflows**: Human intervention required for data sensitivity labeling
- **Limited Real-time Processing**: Batch-oriented processes causing data governance delays  
- **Complex Multi-Tenant Management**: Insufficient organization-level isolation and control
- **Fragmented Compliance Reporting**: Disparate systems for different regulatory frameworks

#### **3. Advanced Feature Gaps**
- **Intelligent Pattern Recognition**: Limited AI/ML-driven classification capabilities
- **Cross-System Orchestration**: Lack of unified workflow management across data sources
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Insufficient continuous compliance and quality monitoring
- **Advanced Analytics**: Limited insights into data governance effectiveness
