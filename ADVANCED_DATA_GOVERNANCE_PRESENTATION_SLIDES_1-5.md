## **Slide 4: Problematic Analysis - Part 1**

### **Critical Limitations in Current Platforms**

#### **1. Unsupported Database Server Challenge**
**Microsoft Azure Purview Integration Runtime Limitations:**
- **MySQL:** No direct native connector support
- **MongoDB:** Limited document database integration
- **PostgreSQL:** Indirect integration through complex workarounds
- **Other NoSQL/NewSQL:** Minimal or no support

**Business Impact:**
- **Data Silos:** 40-60% of enterprise data remains ungoverned
- **Manual Processes:** Increased operational overhead by 300%
- **Compliance Risks:** Regulatory exposure due to ungoverned data assets
- **Cost Implications:** Additional licensing and integration costs

#### **2. Technical Architecture Constraints**
- **Integration Runtime Dependencies:** Requires complex setup for unsupported sources
- **Limited Customization:** Rigid governance models
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Scalability issues with large-scale environments
- **Manual Classification:** Time-intensive data sensitivity labeling

## **Slide 5: Problematic Analysis - Part 2**

### **Advanced Challenges & Solution Requirements**

#### **3. Enterprise Governance Gaps**
**Process Inefficiencies:**
- **Manual Data Classification:** 70% manual effort in sensitivity labeling
- **Reactive Compliance:** Post-incident governance rather than proactive
- **Siloed Operations:** Disconnected governance processes across teams
- **Limited Automation:** Minimal workflow orchestration capabilities

#### **4. Advanced Feature Limitations**
**Missing Enterprise Capabilities:**
- **Real-time Cross-system Orchestration:** Limited workflow automation
- **AI-powered Intelligent Discovery:** Basic pattern recognition
- **Advanced RBAC Integration:** Complex access control management
