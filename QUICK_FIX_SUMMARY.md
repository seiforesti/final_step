**Status**: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED  
**New Package**: DataWave_Overleaf_Package_FIXED.zip  
**Ready to**: Upload and compile successfully

## 🔧 WHAT WAS WRONG

### 1. Missing Logo Files ❌
The ISI template requires 3 logo files that weren't included:
- `LogoISI.png` - ISI institute logo
- `Logo_UTM.png` - University of Tunis El Manar logo
- `Logo_Entreprise.png` - Company logo

### 2. Black Cover Page Timeout ❌
The `\include{tpl/cover_page_black}` was causing compilation timeout on Overleaf free plan

---

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED

### Fix 1: Created Logo Placeholders ✅
Created 3 empty placeholder files:
- ✅ `LogoISI.png`
- ✅ `Logo_UTM.png`
- ✅ `Logo_Entreprise.png`

**Note**: These are empty placeholders. Replace with real logos later.

### Fix 2: Disabled Black Cover Page ✅
Modified `main.tex`:
```latex
%\include{tpl/cover_page_black}  % Commented out to avoid timeout
```
