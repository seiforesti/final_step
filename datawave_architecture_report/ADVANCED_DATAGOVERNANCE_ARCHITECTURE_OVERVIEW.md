# Advanced DataGovernance System - Complete Architecture Overview
## Enterprise-Grade Data Governance Platform Architecture Report

---

### üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION & DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**

This comprehensive architectural report presents the complete end-to-end architecture of the **PurSight DataGovernance System**, an enterprise-grade data governance platform designed for large-scale production environments. Our architectural approach follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles with **Microservices Architecture** patterns, implementing **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** for scalability and **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** for optimal performance.

### üéØ **WHY THIS ARCHITECTURE WAS CHOSEN**

Our architectural decisions are based on the following core principles:

1. **Scalability-First Design**: Built to handle petabyte-scale data governance across multiple cloud providers
2. **Enterprise Integration**: Seamless integration with existing enterprise systems (Azure Purview, AWS Glue, Databricks, Snowflake)
3. **Advanced AI/ML Integration**: Native support for intelligent data discovery, classification, and governance automation
4. **Security-by-Design**: Zero-trust architecture with advanced RBAC and compliance frameworks
5. **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven architecture for real-time data governance and monitoring
6. **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture for custom rules, classifiers, and integrations

### üèõÔ∏è **CORE ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS**

- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**: Clean separation of business logic from external dependencies
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing**: Optimized read/write operations with complete audit trails
- **Microservices with Domain Boundaries**: 7 core domain services + Racine Main Manager orchestration
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized API management with rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Resilience and fault tolerance across service communications
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management across microservices

### üìä **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

The PurSight DataGovernance System is architected as a **distributed, cloud-native platform** consisting of:

#### **üîß Core Architecture Components**

1. **Frontend Layer** (React/TypeScript + Advanced UI Components)
2. **API Gateway Layer** (FastAPI + Advanced Middleware)
3. **Microservices Layer** (7 Core Domain Services + Racine Manager)
4. **Data Layer** (PostgreSQL + Redis + Vector Database)
5. **Integration Layer** (Multi-cloud connectors + Event Streaming)
6. **AI/ML Layer** (Advanced classification + Intelligent discovery)
7. **Security Layer** (Advanced RBAC + Compliance frameworks)

#### **üè¢ Core Business Domains (7 Groups)**

1. **Data Sources Management** - Multi-cloud data source discovery and integration
2. **Compliance Rules Engine** - Advanced compliance framework with 50+ rule types
3. **Classification System** - AI-powered data classification and sensitivity labeling
4. **Scan-Rule-Sets** - Intelligent scanning orchestration and rule management
5. **Data Catalog** - Enterprise-grade metadata management and data discovery
6. **Scan Logic** - Advanced scanning engine with real-time processing
7. **RBAC System** - Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions

#### **üéØ Racine Main Manager (Orchestration Layer)**

The **Racine Main Manager** serves as the central orchestration and workflow management system, providing:
- **Workspace Management**: Multi-tenant workspace isolation and management
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Complex data governance workflow automation
- **Pipeline Management**: Data processing pipeline orchestration
- **AI Coordination**: Centralized AI/ML model management and deployment
- **Activity Monitoring**: Real-time system activity tracking and analytics
- **Collaboration Hub**: Team collaboration and governance decision workflows
