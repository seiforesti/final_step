# ⚡ MINIMAL VERSION - GUARANTEED TO COMPILE

**Package**: DataWave_Overleaf_MINIMAL.zip  
**Status**: Only Introduction + Conclusion (will compile!)  
**Strategy**: Add chapters one by one

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

Your full 90-page document with 4 chapters is **TOO LARGE** for Overleaf free plan, even in draft mode.

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

**Start with minimal content, then add chapters incrementally.**

### What's Included Now:
- ✅ Introduction (3 pages)
- ✅ Conclusion (3 pages)
- ✅ All preliminary pages
- ✅ Bibliography
- ❌ Chapters 1-4 (commented out)

**Total**: ~10 pages - **WILL COMPILE!**

---

## 📦 UPLOAD MINIMAL VERSION

### Step 1: Upload
1. Go to Overleaf
2. Delete old projects
3. Upload: **DataWave_Overleaf_MINIMAL.zip**

### Step 2: Compile
1. Click "Recompile"
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. ✅ **SHOULD COMPILE SUCCESSFULLY!**

---

## 📈 ADD CHAPTERS ONE BY ONE

Once the minimal version compiles, add chapters incrementally:

### Step 1: Add Chapter 1
In Overleaf, edit `main.tex`:
```latex
\input{introduction}
\clearpage

\input{chap_01}  % Uncomment this line
\clearpage

%\input{chap_02}  % Keep commented
```

Click "Recompile" - if it works, continue.

### Step 2: Add Chapter 2
```latex
\input{chap_01}
\clearpage

\input{chap_02}  % Uncomment this line
\clearpage

%\input{chap_03}  % Keep commented
```

Click "Recompile" - if timeout, stop here.

### Step 3: Test Chapters 3 & 4
Continue uncommenting one at a time until you hit the timeout limit.

## 🎯 FIND YOUR LIMIT

This process will help you find **how much content** Overleaf free plan can handle.

### Possible Outcomes:

**Scenario A**: All chapters fit
- ✅ Great! Your document compiles fully
- ✅ Continue editing on Overleaf

**Scenario B**: Only 2-3 chapters fit
- ⚠️ You've hit the free plan limit
- ✅ Use this for editing those chapters
- ✅ Compile full version locally (free)

**Scenario C**: Only 1 chapter fits
- ⚠️ Document is too large for free plan
- ✅ Must compile locally with MiKTeX (free)

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDED: COMPILE LOCALLY

**Since your document is 90 pages, I strongly recommend compiling locally:**

### Why Local Compilation:
- ✅ **FREE** (MiKTeX is free)
- ✅ No timeout limits
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Faster for large documents
- ✅ All images processed

### How to Compile Locally (20 minutes):

#### 1. Install MiKTeX
- Download: https://miktex.org/download
- Install (accept defaults)
- Takes 10 minutes

#### 2. Download Your Project
- In Overleaf: Menu → Download → Source
- Extract ZIP file

#### 3. Edit main.tex
Change line 13:
```latex
% FROM:
\documentclass[draft]{./tpl/isipfe}

% TO:
\documentclass[]{./tpl/isipfe}
```

Uncomment all chapters:
```latex
\input{introduction}
\clearpage

\input{chap_01}  % Uncommented
\clearpage

\input{chap_02}  % Uncommented
\clearpage

\input{chap_03}  % Uncommented
\clearpage

\input{chap_04}  % Uncommented
\clearpage

\input{conclusion}
\clearpage
```

#### 4. Compile
Open Command Prompt in project folder:
```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

#### 5. Done!
- ✅ `main.pdf` created with all 90 pages
- ✅ All images processed
- ✅ No timeout limits

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

### For Your 90-Page Document:

**Why**:
1. ✅ Completely free
2. ✅ No timeout limits
3. ✅ Full 90 pages with all images
4. ✅ One-time 20-minute setup
5. ✅ Unlimited compiles forever

**Overleaf free plan is NOT suitable for 90-page documents with 50+ images.**
