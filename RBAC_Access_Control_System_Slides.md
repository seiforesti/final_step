# RBAC/Access Control System - Presentation Slides

**RBAC System Management Overview:**
The RBAC/Access Control system serves as the unified security wrapper and modular foundation that enforces enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and access management across all data governance modules. It provides advanced OAuth integration, hierarchical role management, attribute-based access control (ABAC), and comprehensive audit logging to ensure the highest security standards for sensitive data operations.

## Slide 1: RBAC System Architecture & Core Components

- **Unified Security Foundation**: Centralized authentication and authorization system that wraps and protects all data governance modules with enterprise-grade security controls.
- **Advanced OAuth Integration**: Multi-provider OAuth support (Google, Microsoft, Email) with secure token management, session handling, and API key authentication for programmatic access.
- **Hierarchical Role Management**: Multi-level role inheritance system with built-in roles (admin, data_steward, data_analyst, viewer) and custom role creation supporting complex organizational structures.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Dynamic permission evaluation based on user attributes (department, region, role level), resource ownership, time-based access windows, and ML risk scoring for intelligent access decisions.
- **Resource-Level Scoping**: Granular permission assignment at data source, database, schema, table, and collection levels with hierarchical inheritance and resource tree management.
- **Comprehensive Audit System**: Real-time logging of all access attempts, permission changes, role assignments, and security events with detailed metadata, correlation IDs, and compliance reporting.

## Slide 2: Advanced Security Features & Integration

- **Multi-Modal Authentication**: Session-based authentication with secure cookies, Bearer token support, MFA integration, and API key management for different access patterns and security requirements.
- **Dynamic Permission Evaluation**: Real-time permission checking with condition-based access control, resource ownership validation, and intelligent context-aware authorization decisions.
- **Cross-Module Security Integration**: Seamless integration with all 6 core data governance modules (Data Sources, Classifications, Compliance, Scan Logic, Scan Rule Sets, Data Catalog) providing consistent security enforcement.
- **Enterprise Security Controls**: Deny assignments for explicit access restrictions, access request workflows with approval processes, periodic access reviews, and bulk permission management for large-scale operations.
- **Advanced Monitoring & Analytics**: Real-time security monitoring, access pattern analysis, risk assessment, and comprehensive audit trails with WebSocket-based live updates for security administrators.
- **Production-Ready Security**: Circuit breaker patterns, rate limiting, session caching, performance optimization, and scalable architecture designed for enterprise production environments.

## Slide 3: OAuth System Design & Advanced Security Architecture

- **Modular OAuth Framework**: Extensible OAuth provider system supporting multiple identity providers with standardized authentication flows, token validation, and user profile synchronization.
- **Advanced Token Management**: Secure token storage with encryption, automatic token refresh, session invalidation, and comprehensive token lifecycle management for enhanced security.
- **Enterprise Identity Integration**: Deep integration with organizational identity systems, group membership synchronization, and automatic role provisioning based on organizational hierarchy and department structures.
- **Security-First Design**: Zero-trust security model with principle of least privilege, comprehensive input validation, SQL injection prevention, and advanced security headers for protection against common attack vectors.
- **Compliance & Governance**: Built-in support for regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, SOC2) with detailed audit logging, data retention policies, and privacy controls for sensitive data access management.
- **Scalable Security Architecture**: High-performance security system designed for enterprise scale with connection pooling, caching strategies, and distributed security enforcement across multiple data governance modules.
