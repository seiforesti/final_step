Executive Summary
The Compliance Rules System provides continuous, automated assurance against frameworks such as SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA,
and PCI-DSS. It defines rules (type, severity, scope), evaluates them on governed assets, produces issues with remediation
plans, and coordinates workflows. It integrates with scans, catalog, classification, RBAC, and the Racine orchestration layer
to deliver a verifiable, auditable compliance posture.
1. Domain Model and Relationships
1.1 Core Entities
ComplianceRule: Policy unit with business and technical definition.
Attributes: name/description, rule_type and severity, lifecycle status, scope
(GLOBAL/DATA_SOURCE/SCHEMA/TABLE/COLUMN), tags and metadata.
Definition: condition, parameters, thresholds, alert conditions; references to standards (e.g., GDPR, SOX, HIPAA) and
remediation guidance.
Targeting: data source filters and source type filters; optional linkage to ScanRuleSet and custom scan rules for
policy-driven scans.
Governance: organization ownership for multi-tenancy; Racine orchestration linkage for enterprise workflows.
Metrics: pass_rate and entity counters for posture tracking.
ComplianceRuleEvaluation: Result of evaluating a rule at a point in time.
Records status (compliant/non/partial/error), compliance_score, issues_found, execution_time, entities_processed,
and contextual data (scan outcomes, security checks).
ComplianceIssue: A tracked gap tied to a rule and optionally a specific entity or data source.
Attributes: severity, status lifecycle (open/in_progress/resolved/accepted_risk), remediation plan/steps, ownership,
due dates, priority, dependencies, impacts, and audit stamps.
1.3 Scope semantics and resolution
(GLOBAL/DATA_SOURCE/SCHEMA/TABLE/COLUMN)
Scopes determine the exact granularity where a rule is applied. The system resolves scope against catalog metadata and
scan discoveries:
GLOBAL: Applies platform-wide to all organizationsâ€™ eligible assets (subject to tenant isolation). Use for universal policies
like <PII must be encrypted at rest.=
DATA_SOURCE: Applies to specific sources (e.g., one PostgreSQL instance). Targeted via many-to-many link or by
data_source_filters (type, tags, criticality). Example: <Enable TLS for all connections to Production PostgreSQL.=
SCHEMA: Applies to one or more schemas within targeted sources. Example: <Finance schemas must not contain
unmasked PAN.=
TABLE: Applies at table level. Example: <Access to customers table requires row-level controls and quarterly reviews.=
COLUMN: Applies to specific columns. Example: <Columns labeled PII must be AES-256 encrypted and masked in
non-prod.=
Resolution rules and precedence:
The engine first restricts by tenant/org, then by targeted data sources (links/filters), then by entity scope
(schema/table/column).
More specific scopes override or refine broader ones when both match (COLUMN > TABLE > SCHEMA > DATA_SOURCE >
GLOBAL).
Catalog and classification contexts supply the concrete entity lists (e.g., which columns are labeled PII) used to evaluate
conditions.
1.2 Interconnections
With Data Sources: Many-to-many mapping allows a rule to target one or more sources; filters constrain scope.
With Scan Rule Sets and Scans: Rules can reference scan rule sets; evaluations can auto-trigger scans or consume latest
scan results for evidence.
With Catalog: Scope resolves against catalog entities (schemas/tables/columns); lineage supports impact analysis.
With Classification: Sensitivity labels inform rule conditions and risk weighting.
With Racine: Orchestration coordinates evaluation waves, remediation workflows, SLAs, and priority; telemetry feeds
scaling and retries.
With RBAC: All operations are permission-gated and auditable, supporting multi-tenant isolation.
2. Lifecycle and Operations
2.1 Rule Authoring and Governance
Define rule intent (standard, internal policy), map to severity and business impact.
Choose scope and targeting (global, per source, per entity type); attach tags/metadata for discoverability.
Configure condition/parameters, thresholds, alerting, remediation steps, and automation flags (e.g., auto_remediation,
auto_scan_on_evaluation).
Manage lifecycle: draft â†’ active â†’ under_review/deprecated.
2.2 Evaluation Execution
Triggers: scheduled (daily/weekly/monthly), on-change (e.g., catalog/schema changes), or manual.
Context assembly: combine catalog entities, classification labels, and recent scan outcomes as evaluation input.
Computation: determine status and compliance_score; aggregate entity counts (tables, columns, etc.).
Persistence: store evaluation summary and context for auditability; update pass_rate on rule.
Issue handling: create or update issues per entity difference; avoid duplication (idempotent updates) and assign
ownership.
2.4 End-to-end flow with scope
Select rule and resolve tenant/org context.1.
Resolve scope: GLOBAL â†’ filter; or map to concrete data sources/schemas/tables/columns via catalog and classification.2.
Assemble evidence: latest scan results, entity metadata, sensitivity labels, and performance/security checks as required
by the rule.
3.
Evaluate condition and parameters per targeted entity; compute compliance_score and status.4.
. Record evaluation; open/update issues for failing entities; attach remediation guidance and owners.5
If configured, trigger remediation workflow or new scans; notify per alert conditions.6.
2.3 Remediation and Workflow
Issue management: severity-driven prioritization, assignment, due dates, remediation plan/steps, and progress tracking.
Workflows: initiate remediation workflows with steps and approvals; link to SLAs and escalation policies via Racine.
Outcomes: resolution (fixed) or accepted risk with justification; retest rules to verify closure.

Classifications_base
Classifications System â€“ Simplified Deep Dive
(Implementation & Integrations)
1) Purpose and Position in the Platform
The Classifications System tags enterprise data assets with sensitivity and business meaning, so downstream governance
(compliance, access control, catalog, lineage, analytics) can act correctly. It works across all supported sources (on-prem and
cloud) and is orchestrated by the Racine Main Manager to run reliably at scale.
2) What It Manages (Concepts and Models)
Classification Frameworks: An organizationâ€™s standard for how data should be classified (scope, rules, policies,
governance owners, approvals).
Policies: Guardrails that decide defaults, inheritance, notifications, and when approvals are required.
Rules: How to detect a class (regex, dictionary, name/type/value/statistics patterns, composite logic, ML/AI inference)
with priority and scope.
Dictionaries: Curated terms (multi-language) used by rules with quality/validation metadata.
Results: The classification decisions attached to entities (data source, schema, table, column, scan result, catalog item)
with confidence, evidence, and lifecycle metadata.
Links: Bridges to scans and catalog items to ensure propagation, search boost, lineage impact, and recommendations.
Settings per Data Source: Auto-classify toggles, selected framework, defaults, batch and parallelism, inheritance
behavior.
3) How It Works (Service Logic)
Pipeline (no code, high-level):
Framework Activation: A framework is chosen for a data source; governance and approvals can be required. Activation
can auto-trigger classification of existing assets.
1.
Rule Resolution: The service gathers active rules applicable to the entityâ€™s scope (global, data source, schema, table,
column) ordered by priority.
2.
Feature Extraction: The service extracts relevant text/metadata/samples from the entity (names, types, descriptions,
sample values, schema/table paths).
3.
Pattern Matching & AI: Each rule type is applied (regex, dictionary with fuzzy match, names/types/ranges/statistics,
composite logic, ML/AI inference). Confidence is computed per match.
4.
Decision & Evidence: A result is created with sensitivity, confidence, matched patterns/values, context, samples, and
timings.
5.
Post-Processing: Stop rules on high-confidence matches when appropriate; propagate to catalog; update search indices
and lineage flags; emit audit logs; update rule metrics.
6.
Review & Overrides: Validation workflows support human review, overrides, and approvals with auditability. Inheritance
can propagate up/down the hierarchy.
7.
Performance & Reliability:
Caching: Compiled patterns and dictionary entries are cached and reused.
Ordering & Short-Circuiting: Priority ordering plus break-on-strong-match reduce work.
Batch/Parallel: Tunable batch size and parallel jobs per data source.
Background Jobs: Large scans run asynchronously with progress tracking and notifications.
Metrics & Health: Service exposes health, performance, capacity, and compliance metrics.
4) Where Itâ€™s Exposed (API Responsibilities)
Frameworks: Create/list/get/update/delete; validate; detect conflicts; report capabilities; security validation; fallback
selection.
Rules: Create/list/get/update; validate; analyze performance; optimize; security validation.
Application: Apply to scan results (on demand or background) and catalog items (with business context).
Data Source Settings: Read/update auto-classify, selected framework, inheritance, performance parameters.
Data Processing: Preprocess, assess quality, enrich, sample; text/structured/image preparation for better classification.
System Health: Health/performance/capacity/compliance metrics; emergency response hooks.
5) How It Integrates with Other Modules
Scans: After discovery, results are classified automatically (if enabled). Links store which results were classified, the
trigger, iteration, and quality scores.
Catalog: Classifications attach to catalog items, improving search, relevance, and business context; lineage flags are
updated for downstream impact analysis.
Compliance: Rules and sensitivity map to frameworks (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS and others) to measure posture,
drive remediation, and generate reports.
RBAC/Access: Sensitivity influences access decisions; audit trails and reviewer approvals are enforced by RBAC policies.
Racine Orchestrator: Schedules/coordinates large jobs, approvals, escalations, SLAs, and cross-module workflows for
resilience at scale.
6) End-to-End Lifecycle (Typical Flow)
Authoring: Governance team defines frameworks, policies, and rules, linking to compliance where applicable;
dictionaries curated and validated.
1.
Activation: Framework bound to a data source; auto-classification enabled; initial run scheduled.2.
Execution: During/after scanning, the engine classifies each entity; results include sensitivity, confidence, and evidence;
rule statistics updated.
3.
Propagation: Results flow into the catalog; indices and lineage are refreshed; compliance posture recalculated.4.
Review: Stakeholders validate sensitive hits, resolve conflicts, or override; exceptions can be granted with approvals.5.
Monitoring: Dashboards expose throughput, accuracy, error rates, cache hit ratio, and compliance score; alerts fire on
regressions.
6.
Optimization: Rule validation, performance analysis, ordering optimization, and dictionary quality improvements keep
the system fast and accurate.
7.
7) Security, Privacy, and Audit
Sensitivity & Privacy: PII/PHI/PCI and other categories are identified, masked where required, and governed across
environments.
Access Controls: RBAC protects rule authoring, execution, and results. Minimum-necessary principles enforced.
Encryption & Transport: Sensitive data and evidence are protected in motion and at rest according to policy.
Auditability: Every significant action is logged with who/what/when/where and risk/compliance flags; reports satisfy
internal and external audits.
8) Resilience & Operations
Failure Isolation: Background execution, retries, and graceful degradation avoid cascading failures.
Capacity Planning: Capacity and performance endpoints support scaling decisions; PgBouncer and DB pool policies keep
the system stable under load.
Self-Healing: Health checks, circuit breakers, throttling, and request collapsing (in the platform middleware) preserve
uptime.
Runbook Guidance: If accuracy drops, first check dictionary freshness, rule conflicts, cache hit ratio, and sampling
configuration before scaling.
9) KPIs and Executive Signals
Coverage: % assets classified; % columns with sensitivity.
Accuracy: Validation acceptance rate; false positive/negative trends.
Performance: Avg processing time; entries/second; cache hit ratio.
Compliance: Framework pass rate; violations by severity; time-to-remediate.
Business Impact: Search relevancy lift; time saved vs manual; incidents prevented.
10) Why Itâ€™s Production-Ready
Clear separation of concerns between models, services, and routes.
Strong integration points with Scan, Catalog, Compliance, RBAC, and Racine.
Performance levers (caching, batching, parallelism) are tunable per data source.
Full observability (metrics, logs, audit) and operational controls (health, capacity, emergency response).
This deep dive explains the implementation approach and module integrations without code, highlighting how the system
achieves accuracy, scale, and governance quality while remaining auditable and production-ready.

Scans Execution across data sources
Purpose: Central brain for executing scans across data sources using workflows and orchestration.
Page 2
Workflow-driven Execution
Core building blocks: scan definitions, execution
records, rule configurations, workflow stages,
orchestration jobs.
stage-by-stage progression through welldefined gates (INIT â†’ VALIDATE â†’ PROCESS â†’
ANALYZE â†’ REPORT â†’ CLEANUP) with
conditional branches and approvals.
When to use: complex, governance-heavy
processes requiring human-in-the-loop
checkpoints, strict compliance gates, and
deterministic stage progression.
Strengths: explicit stage DAG, reusable
templates, stage-level SLAs, auditability per gate,
fine-grained retries/backoff/timeouts, and stagescoped secrets/permissions.
Execution model: each stage validates
preconditions, executes scoped tasks, records
outcomes/metrics, and emits events for
downstream stages or approvals.
Failure handling: stage isolation with
compensating or cleanup stages, resumable
runs, policy-driven escalations, and re-approval
on scope or risk changes.
Integration: natural points to invoke
classification, compliance validation, catalog
enrichment, notifications, and governance
reviews at ANALYZE/REPORT checkpoints.
Orchestration-driven
global plan that allocates resources, batches work, and coordinates
parallel/sequential runs across sources based on priorities and
constraints.
When to use: high-throughput, multi-source or multi-tenant operations
demanding resource-aware scheduling, batching, and adaptive
concurrency for cost/performance.
Strengths: predictive resource allocation, priority queues, dynamic
strategy selection (sequential/parallel/adaptive/intelligent), co-location
and batching by complexity.
Resource & performance: respects connection limits,
CPU/memory/network budgets; applies throttling and circuit-breaking;
auto-scales workers based on live telemetry.
Backpressure & scaling: smooths spikes via queues and rate control,
defers non-urgent work, and balances loads across windows and pools.
Recovery & resilience: hot-retry for transient faults, smart rescheduling
to alternate windows/resources, quarantine of noisy batches, and
idempotent updates.
2
Mode selection & hybrid use
Combining both, let workflows enforce governance and approvals at gates, while orchestration maximizes performance within those governed windows,
feeding telemetry back to tune future plans and rule sampling
Hybrid pattern: wrap Orchestration inside Workflow stages, Workflow governs gates/approvals and compliance; Orchestration maximizes performance
within governed windows..

How Scan Logic Operates and Integrates
Scheduling and triggers: calendar/cron-based runs; event- and
manual triggers for on-demand scans.
Execution pipeline:
Validation: source reachability, permissions, rule sanity;
dependency checks.
Planning: resource sizing, strategy selection
(sequential/parallel/intelligent), stage graph build.
Execution: rule batches executed; progress, retries, backoff,
timeouts.
Post-processing: persist results, catalog enrichment,
classification/compliance hooks.
System integration: ties into Data Catalog, Classifications,
Compliance, Lineage, Analytics via integration contracts.
Performance: connection pooling, thread/async execution, caching,
adaptive concurrency, predictive resource allocation.
Scan Rule Sets vs. Scan Logic
Scan Rule Sets â€“ Advanced Functionalities (WHAT)
Define WHAT to scan: rich scoping controls, rule templates, AI pattern
recognition, and enterprise governance with lifecycle management.
Reusable rule libraries: version control, approval workflows,
business/compliance mappings, and cross-source portability for
consistent data governance.
Scan Logic â€“ Advanced Functionalities (HOW)
Orchestrate HOW scans execute: workflow engines, resource-aware
scheduling, AI optimization, and adaptive execution strategies across
multiple sources.
Enterprise reliability: predictive allocation, priority queues, real-time
monitoring, failure recovery, and comprehensive observability for
production operations.
Relationship & Interaction (HOW consumes WHAT)
Scan Logic consumes rule sets to build execution plans and orchestrated
workflows, while feeding results back to optimize rule baselines and
governance KPIs.
Cross-module integration: scan outcomes drive catalog enrichment,
classification labels, compliance validations, and lineage tracking across
the entire platform.
 02/1
Key Differences in the Project
Focus: Rule Sets describe WHAT to scan and which rules apply; Scan
Logic defines HOW, WHEN, and WITH WHAT resources they execute.
Data model anchors: Rule Setsâ€”rule sets and rule catalogs; Scan
Logicâ€”workflows, orchestration plans, executions, and resource
allocations.
Ownership & lifecycle: Rule Sets managed by governance teams
(templates, reviews, versions); Scan Logic owned by platform/ops
(scheduling, orchestration SLAs, performance).
Failure domains: Rule issues â†’ validation or rule-set quality gates;
Execution issues â†’ retries, recovery stages, rescheduling, or
reallocation.
Scalability levers: Rule Setsâ€”scope reduction, sampling, rule
optimization; Scan Logicâ€”strategy choice, concurrency, resource
pools, intelligent batching.
Scan Logic Base System â€” Deep Technical
Analysis (Hidden)
1. Executive Overview
The Scan Logic base system is the runtime brain that plans, schedules, executes, monitors, and optimizes scanning across
heterogeneous data sources. It orchestrates the execution of scan rules (classification, quality, compliance, security) over
defined scopes, integrates with surrounding governance systems (Catalog, Compliance, Classification, Lineage), and
provides enterprise-grade reliability, observability, and performance controls.
This document explains exactly how Scan Logic is modeled, executed, and integrated in PurSight:
Domain models that represent scans, executions, rules, results, schedules, workflows, and orchestration jobs
Services that plan and execute scans (ScanService, ScanSchedulerService, ScanWorkflowEngine,
ScanOrchestrationService)
API routes that expose intelligent scanning capabilities and live monitoring
Integration pathways to Catalog, Classification, Compliance, Lineage, and Analytics
Reliability, performance, and security mechanisms underpinning production operation
2. Core Domain Models (What the system acts upon)
2.1 Data source and scope models
DataSource (in app/models/scan_models.py) captures connection details, pool sizing, cloud/hybrid context,
organizational and orchestrator linkage, and operational telemetry (health, error rates, QPS, etc.). It is the anchor for any
scan.
ScanRuleSet defines WHAT to scan: include/exclude lists at schema/table/column levels, sampling toggles and size. It can
be associated with a DataSource and with Compliance relationships. Enhanced variants (EnhancedScanRuleSet) add
enterprise orchestration knobs (AI pattern recognition, intelligent sampling, resource limits, priorities, validation &
quality thresholds, ML references, catalogs, audit, SLAs).
2.2 Scan and results models
Scan tracks a single scan run: UUID, source, optional rule set, status lifecycle (PENDING â†’ RUNNING â†’
COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED), timestamps, and relationships to results.
ScanResult stores per-object outcomes (schema/table/column), classification labels, sensitivity, compliance issues,
technical metadata, and arbitrary scan_metadata. These records are the bridge to downstream enrichment.
2.3 Rule definition and execution tracking
ScanRule represents an enterprise rule: type/category/severity, rule expression/config/dependencies, AI flags, resource
requirements, lifecycle and performance metrics. It can belong to an enhanced rule set; it is the atomic logical unit the
execution engines will run.
ScanExecution captures per-rule execution across contexts (which scan/orchestration, environment, progression,
timings, resource usage, outputs, errors, retries, validation, alerts, audit, tags). This enables granular analytics and
auditability.
2.4 Scheduling and discovery
ScanSchedule defines cron-based recurring scans, binding a DataSource and a ScanRuleSet, with last_run/next_run
management.
DiscoveryHistory records discovery operations (used when scans do schema discovery and store metadata), including
counts, durations, status, and details.
2.5 Workflow and orchestration (HOW scans run)
ScanWorkflowTemplate, ScanWorkflow, WorkflowStage, WorkflowTask, WorkflowCondition, WorkflowTrigger,
WorkflowApproval, ScanWorkflowExecutionDetail
Define reusable templates and concrete workflows; each workflow includes ordered stages (INIT, VALIDATION,
PROCESSING, ANALYSIS, REPORTING, CLEANUP, etc.), each with tasks (SCAN_EXECUTION, DATA_COLLECTION,
QUALITY_ASSESSMENT, COMPLIANCE_CHECK, CLASSIFICATION, LINEAGE_TRACKING, NOTIFICATION,
APPROVAL_REQUEST, DATA_EXPORT, CUSTOM_SCRIPT), conditions, retries, timeouts, and dependencies.
Orchestration models in scan_models provide enterprise job-level coordination:
ScanOrchestrationJob with strategy, priority, targets, execution config, performance/quality/business metrics, and
relationships to EnhancedScanRuleSet and ScanWorkflowExecution.
ScanWorkflowExecution for per-step tracking within orchestration jobs (status, timings, resource usage, outputs,
errors, dependencies, quality, cost, audit).
ScanResourceAllocation for CPU/memory/network/storage/DB connections/API limits allocation tracking with costs
and efficiency.
3. Service Layer (How execution is planned and performed)
3.1 ScanService â€” unit scan execution
Responsibilities:
CRUD for Scan, status transitions, and storage of ScanResult.
Execution method execute_scan() that:
Validates scan state and sets RUNNING.a.
Loads DataSource and optional ScanRuleSet.b.
Extracts metadata using extraction adapters per DB type via _extract_*_metadata(); payload includes include/exclude
filters from the rule set.
c.
Persists results into ScanResult with table/column detail.d.
Creates a DiscoveryHistory record and transitions to COMPLETED; on errors, records FAILED with discovery entry.e.
Storage path _store_scan_results() is format-aware (SQL vs MongoDB), normalizes schemas/tables/columns.
Health endpoint calculations: computes success rate and service health.
Execution behavior:
Uses async-friendly patterns; spawns task when loop exists; otherwise executes inline.
ThreadPoolExecutor is used to offload blocking extraction HTTP calls.
Robust status/timestamp updates; idempotent error handling for partial failures.
3.2 ScanSchedulerService â€” recurring execution
Manages ScanSchedule CRUD, cron validation (croniter), next_run computation.
The scheduler loop periodically looks up due schedules, creates a Scan via ScanService.create_scan, invokes
ScanService.execute_scan, and advances schedule times.
This provides hands-free periodic scanning with clear audit of runs.
3.3 ScanWorkflowEngine â€” staged, conditional, governable execution
Provides an enterprise workflow runtime for scan logic.
Components:
Stage executors for INIT, VALIDATION, PROCESSING, ANALYSIS, REPORTING, CLEANUP, NOTIFICATION, APPROVAL,
CUSTOM.
Task handlers mapping TaskType to concrete operations (e.g., _handle_scan_execution_task submits a scan request
via the orchestrator and monitors it; others perform data collection, quality assessment, compliance checks,
classification, lineage tracking, notifications, approvals, exports).
Condition evaluators (EQUALS, IN, REGEX, etc.), retries, timeouts, escalation, auto-approval, and periodic
health/metrics loops.
Lifecycle:
Create workflow from template; merge defaults and variables.a.
Initialize ordered stages and tasks with per-stage timeouts/retries and conditions.b.
Execute stages in order respecting dependencies; update progress; fail-fast on critical stage failures; otherwise
continue.
c.
Persist/emit metrics; generate a workflow report; move to completed/failed ring buffers.d.
Optimization:
Background loops analyze throughput, failure rates, average durations, and template stats; produce
recommendations and adjust baselines.
Escalation/approval management loops ensure governance and responsiveness.
3.4 ScanOrchestrationService â€” resource-aware, AI-optimized coordination
Designs and executes multi-rule, multi-source plans with strategies (SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL, ADAPTIVE, INTELLIGENT,
PRIORITY_BASED, RESOURCE_OPTIMIZED).
Responsibilities:
Validate scan request (source, rules) using DataSourceConnectionService and EnterpriseScanRuleService.
Analyze resource requirements from source sizing and rule complexity; compute
CPU/memory/storage/network/DB/API needs; estimate duration; compute complexity score.
Check availability vs current allocations; queue if insufficient (priority heap) with wait-time estimates.
Allocate resources with expiry tied to estimated duration + buffer.
Generate execution plan: batching rules sequentially/parallel or using AI optimization
(ScanIntelligenceService.optimize_scan_execution).
Execute each stage; for parallel stages, run rules concurrently; monitor success/failure, attempt recovery (retry with
sequential fallback), update progress and metrics; persist orchestration execution snapshot.
Release resources and update performance metrics (utilization, throughput, success rate).
Optimization & ML:
Maintains RandomForest-based predictors for duration/resource usage; scalers; periodic retraining using historical
data; derives optimization insights and allocation ranges.
Background loops for orchestration queue processing, resource monitoring, performance optimization, and metrics
collection.
4. API Exposure (Scan Logic routes)
The app/api/routes/intelligent_scanning_routes.py file groups endpoints for intelligent scan logic:
Execute logic (/execute): validate, build AI plan, execute via a unified manager (coordination layer), monitor in
background.
Workflow execution (/workflow): validate steps, create workflow via ScanWorkflowEngine, coordinate execution,
monitor.
Orchestration (/orchestrate): create orchestration plan via coordinator, execute via unified manager, monitor.
Analysis (/analyze): perform performance analysis and return optimization recommendations.
Status (/status/{execution_id}): return real-time status/metrics/progress.
Optimization recommendations and performance insights routes; and real-time streaming (/stream/logic-updates).
All endpoints are guarded by RBAC permissions and use dependency-injected services.
These routes provide the external control plane to start/observe/optimize scan logic at runtime.
5. End-to-End Execution Flow (Functional Perspective)
Trigger sources1.
Manual: user calls intelligent scanning endpoints or traditional ScanService execution.
Scheduled: ScanSchedulerService wakes, creates scans, and runs them.
Workflow: ScanWorkflowEngine kicks off a multi-stage plan, possibly invoking orchestrated scans as a task.
Orchestration: ScanOrchestrationService accepts a high-level rule set and target, builds an optimized plan, and executes.
Planning1.
Validate data source and rule set/rules.
Size environment; estimate resources; select strategy (sequential/parallel/adaptive/intelligent) based on complexity and
capacity.
Build stages: group rules to batches, define dependencies and concurrency, define timeouts/retries.
Execution1.
For unit scans: extract metadata, filter by rule set, persist results; update discovery and status.
For orchestrations: for each stage, execute rules (parallel where possible). Update per-rule ScanExecution and stage
results.
For workflows: run tasks in each stage; a scan execution task submits to orchestrator and monitors.
Post-processing and integration1.
Persist results (ScanResult).
Integrate with Classification (labels, sensitivity), Compliance (violations and risk), and Catalog (enrichment) using
integration models.
Optionally trigger lineage updates and analytics.
Monitoring and optimization1.
Status endpoints and SSE streaming provide progress, metrics, and logs.
Background loops compute performance baselines, detect bottlenecks, generate optimization hints, and optionally
auto-tune resource allocations.
6. Integration Points Across the Platform
Data Catalog: ScanCatalogEnrichment links results to catalog assets; orchestration jobs track enrichment and
classification mappings that feed advanced catalog models.
Classification: integration models carry labels and confidence; Scan Logic can call ScanIntelligenceService.classify_items
in workflow tasks.
Compliance: compliance validations and remediation actions captured alongside scan results; rule types and statuses
map to frameworks.
Lineage: workflow tasks can call lineage tracking; orchestrations can compute upstream/downstream impacts.
Analytics: execution metrics feed analytics services for dashboards, trends, ROI, and capacity planning.
7. Reliability, Safety, and Production Controls
Status transitions and timestamps at scan, stage, and task levels with retries, backoffs, and critical vs optional failure
semantics.
Timeouts at stage/task, cancellation pathways, and queued orchestration wait-time estimation.
Resource pools and allocations with expiry; periodic cleanup and leak prevention.
Audit trails and RBAC checks at API entry points; health checks and structured logging.
Idempotent storage paths for results; batch inserts; commit boundaries; robust exception handling.
8. Performance and Scalability Techniques
PgBouncer-backed DB connections; thread/async hybrid execution for blocking I/O.
Parallel stages limited by CPU/DB connections/API rate limit caps.
AI-assisted stage creation and grouping; prediction of durations; adaptive concurrency.
Metrics loops compute throughput/queue depth; optimizers adjust resource ranges and target concurrency.
Caching layers for repeated rule evaluations and metadata warmup.
9. Security and Compliance Considerations
RBAC guards for execute/view/orchestrate/workflow/insights endpoints.
ScanRule carries compliance frameworks and audit requirements; ScanExecution tracks compliance status and alerts.
Sensitive data handling through rule expressions, masking/anonymization strategies in downstream integrations.
Audit trails for changes to plans, approvals, escalations, and execution results.
10. How Scan Logic Differs from Scan Rule Sets (and works
together)
Rule sets define WHAT to scan and the logical rules to apply (scope, expressions, templates, governance lifecycle).
Scan Logic defines HOW to execute: when to run, how to plan, how to allocate resources, which tasks/stages to use, how
to parallelize, and how to recover.
Scan Logic consumes rule sets to create efficient, safe, and predictable executions, then feeds back results and
enrichment to other modules.
11. Example Functional Scenarios (Narrative)
Nightly enterprise scan across 200 tables1.
Scheduler triggers; ScanOrchestrationService groups rules into parallel stages based on DB connections and CPU.
Execution runs with retries on intermittent failures; stage-level metrics are collected.
Results feed Classification and Catalog enrichment; Compliance violations open remediation tickets.
On-demand PII discovery for a new data source1.
User invokes workflow with VALIDATION â†’ PROCESSING (classification tasks) â†’ REPORTING â†’ NOTIFICATION.
Orchestrator submits scans for the target schemas; workflow waits for completion and assembles a PII report.
Incremental scan under high load1.
Orchestrator detects high utilization; switches strategy to smaller parallel batches; leverages predictions to meet SLA.
Results update Catalog and Quality metrics; optimization loop updates allocation ranges.
12. Operational Metrics and KPIs
Orchestration metrics: total/completed/failed, average orchestration time, stage counts, success rate,
throughput/minute.
Resource metrics: CPU/memory/network/storage utilization, DB connections, API limits, allocation efficiency.
Workflow metrics: queue depth, approvals pending, health status, baseline completion time.
Scan metrics: scan success rate, table/column coverage, findings, violations, classification confidence.
13. Failure Modes and Recovery Strategies
Stage failure: retry with sequential fallback; mark optional stages as skipped; halt on critical stage failure.
Resource exhaustion: queue orchestration; estimate wait; auto-release expired allocations; cancel on timeout.
External service errors: catch and degrade (e.g., notify but continue), or fail-fast depending on stage criticality.
Data source connectivity failure: mark discovery failed; store error; scheduler will retry on next window.
14. Extensibility and Customization
Add new TaskType and handler in ScanWorkflowEngine for custom logic (e.g., ML inference, export target).
Add new orchestration strategy or adjust grouping heuristics; plug-in alternate optimization backends.
Extend ScanRule categories; register specialized evaluators.
Integrate additional systems via new integration models or route modules.
15. Governance and Audit Readiness
Every execution carries creator IDs, timestamps, and audit trails.
Approvals/escalations recorded; RBAC enforced on sensitive operations.
Compliance fields on rules/executions make audit extraction straightforward.
16. Summary â€” Why itâ€™s production-ready
Clear separation of concerns: WHAT (rule sets) vs HOW (logic) with strong contracts.
Battle-tested reliability patterns: retries, timeouts, recovery, idempotent writes, queueing, health checks.
Performance at scale: parallelization under resource constraints, predictive sizing, caching, pooling, metrics.
Integrated intelligence: ML-guided planning and continuous optimization.

How Azure Purview Handles Data Source Connectivity and
Discovery (Baseline)
Integration Runtime (IR): centralized runtime process (self-hosted or managed) that
brokers connectivity to sources, executes ingestion/discovery tasks, and moves/reads
metadata.
Connectivity: uses connectors per source; relies on network routes/VPN/privileged
endpoints through IR; credentials configured via Key Vault/IR.
Discovery & extraction: scheduled/classic crawlers scan schemas/tables, pull metadata
to Purview; scale via more IR nodes; latency depends on central runner placement.
Security & governance: access via Azure AD and role assignments; activity logs in Azure
Monitor; compliance via Azure Policy integrations.
Strengths: managed experience, broad connector coverage, simple onboarding;
Limitations: centralized execution bottlenecks, less edge autonomy, coarse-grained
performance controls, limited adaptive optimization at run-time.

Micro â†’ Macro Governance Factory
(Interconnected Circle)
Micro (edge) layer: connection, discovery, enrichment, and security
enforcement occur close to sources. Outputs: normalized
metadata, health metrics, quality signals.
Handoff bus: streaming/evented transport forwards small,
structured payloads to the macro plane with retries, deduplication,
and ordering.
Macro (platform) layer: specialized microservices consume edge
outputs:
Catalog: asset registration, lineage graph, semantic enrichment,
glossary linking.
Scan Rule Sets: WHAT to analyze with scopes, sampling, and
templates.
Scan Logic: HOW/WHEN to execute with workflows,
orchestration, resource plans.
Classifications: AI/manual labeling, sensitivity levels, validation
loops.
Compliance: framework mapping, policy enforcement,
continuous validation.
RBAC: cross-cutting permissions, access review, audit.
Feedback loop: macro insights (performance, risk, policy) drive
edge reconfiguration (sampling, concurrency, windows) for
continuous optimization.
Key Differentiators vs Azure Purview IR
Execution model: decentralized, edge-first vs centralized IR; reduces latency and blast
radius; improves locality and compliance posture.
Performance control: fine-grained, live-tunable pools, throttling, and batching at edge vs
coarse IR scaling.
Intelligence: AI-enhanced discovery, adaptive strategies, and predictive allocation
embedded at edge vs centrally orchestrated crawls.
Security: ABAC + deny-first evaluation at edge, ephemeral secrets, metadata-only egress
vs broader IR access paths.
Reliability: localized retries, replica failover, and graceful degradation per site vs IR jobcentric retries.
Cost & scale: locality reduces egress; multiplexing increases efficiency; macro plane scales
consumers independently.
