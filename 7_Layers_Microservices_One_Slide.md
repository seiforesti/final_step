## **The 7 Layers of Microservices Architecture**

**The 7-layer microservices architecture provides a scalable, secure, and maintainable foundation for enterprise data governance.**
*Each layer handles specific responsibilities while communicating seamlessly with other layers through well-defined interfaces.*

---

### **🌐 Layer 1: Presentation Layer**
**Modern user interfaces and real-time communication**
*React frontend, mobile apps, API gateways, and WebSocket servers for seamless user experience*

### **🚪 Layer 2: API Gateway Layer**
**API management, security, and request routing**
*Kong gateway with OAuth 2.0, RBAC, rate limiting, and comprehensive API monitoring*

### **🏗️ Layer 3: Business Logic Layer**
**Core microservices and business functionality**
*Data source management, catalog services, AI/ML classification, rule orchestration, and compliance governance*

### **🌐 Layer 4: Edge Computing Layer**
**Distributed processing and edge intelligence**
*On-premises edge nodes, cloud edge processing, and local AI inference for reduced latency*

### **💾 Layer 5: Data Access Layer**
**Data storage, persistence, and retrieval systems**
*PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and S3 for comprehensive data management*

### **☸️ Layer 6: Infrastructure Layer**
**Platform management, monitoring, and DevOps**
*Kubernetes orchestration, Prometheus monitoring, Grafana dashboards, and CI/CD automation*

### **🌍 Layer 7: External Integration Layer**
**Third-party services and cloud provider integration**
*AWS, Azure, GCP cloud services, Slack notifications, Tableau analytics, and enterprise system connectivity*
